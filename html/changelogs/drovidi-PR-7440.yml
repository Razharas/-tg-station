changes:
  - tweak: "Blobs who burst in space will be given a 30 second warning before dying."
  - tweak: "If a blob does die from bursting in space, a new crewmember will be infected."
  - bugfix: "If there are no blobs or infected crew left after bursting, the round will now end properly, rather than becoming endless."
